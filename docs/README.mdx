## Latest Versions (Changelogs)

<div align="left"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/objectbox/objectbox-c?style=for-the-badge" alt=""/></div>

### 4.3.0 (2025-05-12)

* Windows: msvc runtime is now embedded to avoid incompatible msvcp140.dll (e.g. those shipped with some JDKs)
* External property types (via [MongoDB connector](https://sync.objectbox.io/mongodb-sync-connector)): JsonToNative to support sub (embedded/nested) documents/arrays in MongoDB
* External property types (via MongoDB connector): support ID mapping to UUIDs (v4 and v7)
* Admin: add class and dependency diagrams to the schema page (view and download)
* Admin: improved data view for large vectors by displaying only the first elements and the full vector in a dialog
* Admin: detects images stored as bytes and shows them as such (PNG, GIF, JPEG, SVG, WEBP)

#### Sync

* Add "Log Events" for important server events, which can be viewed on new Admin page
* Detect and ignore changes for objects that were put but were unchanged
* The limit for message size was raised to 32 MB
* Transactions above the message size limit will already fail on the client now (to better enforce the limit)
* C++: add missing APIs for JWT token credentials

### 4.2.0 (2025-03-04)

* Extended the model by external names and types: allows defining a different name for an external database, which ObjectBox syncs with.

This prepares upcoming features for our [MongoDB Sync Connector](https://sync.objectbox.io/mongodb-sync-connector).

### 4.1.0 (2025-01-28)

* New query conditions for map properties (via flex properties): now supports key/value pairs for inequality conditions (e.g. greater than, less than) for string, integer and floating point values
* Vector search: add "Geo" distance type for longitude/latitude pairs
* Various internal improvements

#### Sync

* Add JWT authentication
* Sync clients can now send multiple credentials for login

### 4.0 (2024-11-11)

Note: 4.0.3 the first 4.0.x version working with ObjectBox Generator 4.0 and thus is the first full 4.0 release. For individual changes in the runtime library check the GitHub release notes: [4.0.0](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c/releases/tag/v4.0.0), [4.0.1](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c/releases/tag/v4.0.1) and [4.0.2](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c/releases/tag/v4.0.2).

* CMake stubs to easily integrate with [ObjectBox Generator 4.0](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-generator/releases/tag/v4.0.0)
* ObjectBox now supports vector search ("vector database") to enable efficient similarity searches.\
  This is particularly useful for AI/ML/RAG applications, e.g. image, audio, or text similarity.\
  Other use cases include semantic search or recommendation engines.\
  See [https://docs.objectbox.io/ann-vector-search](https://docs.objectbox.io/ann-vector-search) for details.
* Adjusting the version number to match the core version (4.0); we will be aligning on major versions from now on.
* Made closing the store more robust; e.g. it waits for ongoing queries and transactions to finish\
  (please still ensure to clean up properly on your side, this is an additional safety net)
* Made Box API more robust when racing against store closing
* Add "vectorsearch-cities" example

### 0.21.0 (2024-02-13)

* In-memory databases (simply provide a "memory:" prefixed "directory")

#### Sync:

* New client/server statistics API
* New server API to enable authenticators
* Sync server: support for sync permissions, blocks client updates with no write permission
* Added sync-level login/write permissions for Admin Users DB and Web-UI
* New authenticator "ObjectBox Admin" with support for authorization
* New client API for username/password credentials
* New client-side error listener API; initially reports "receive-only" downgrade due to no write permissions.

### 0.20.0 (2023-12-11)

* Added OBXFeature\_Backup to query for the feature's availability
* Internal: added a DB store abstraction layer (another announcement about this will follow)
* Tree API: fix for meta IDs vs. IDs
* Various internal improvements

#### Sync

* Sync clients may now supply multiple URLs; for each connection attempt a random one is chosen. This allows for client-side load balancing and failover with an ObjectBox Sync cluster.

### 0.19.0 (2023-09-04)

* New K/V validation option on opening the store
* Additions cursor API: get current ID, ID-based seeks (seek to first ID, seek to next ID)
* Support scalar vector types with basic queries (APIs only, no generator support)
* Various tree API improvements, e.g. introspection
* Minor API clean up: e.g. using int types for bit flags not enums
* Fixes query link condition in combination with some "or" conditions
* Fixes query "less" condition for case-sensitive strings with value indexes (default is hashed index)
* Updated Linux toolchain; now requires glibc 2.28 or higher (and GLIBCXX\_3.4.25); e.g. the following minium versions are fine: Debian Buster 10 (2019), Ubuntu 20.04, RHEL 8 (2019)
* Various internal improvements
* Sync: various additions and improvements (client and server)

### 0.18.1 (2023-01-30)

* New query condition to match objects that have a given number of relations
* New "max data size" store setting
* Enabled stricter compiler settings
